# Privacy Policy for Ali Grabber
Effective Date: August 22, 2025

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how the Ali Grabber Chrome Extension ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information. Your privacy is critically important to us. Our fundamental policy is that we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.

### Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.

The extension's functionality is limited to the page you are currently viewing. It does not track your browsing history or collect any data about you.

### How We Use Your Information
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use your information in any way. The extension's sole purpose is to identify and download media files from AliExpress product pages as requested by you.

### Permissions Explained
The extension requires the following permissions to function correctly:
- `"sidePanel"`: Allows the extension to display its user interface in the browser's side panel.
- `"scripting"` & `"activeTab"`: Required to run the content script that finds the image and video URLs on the active AliExpress tab. The extension does not read, track, or alter any other content on the webpage.
- `"downloads"`: Necessary to save the media files and the generated ZIP file to your local computer.
- `"tabs"`: Used to ensure the sidebar UI updates correctly when you switch or update tabs.

### Data Storage
The extension does not store any data. All operations are performed in real-time and no information is saved by the extension.

### Third-Party Services
This extension does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. It uses the third-party JSZip library, which runs locally in your browser, to create ZIP files. No data is sent to any third-party server.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
